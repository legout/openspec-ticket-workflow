description: Create a new OpenSpec proposal for a feature or bugfix [ulw]
agent: os-tk-worker

Change ID: $1

Use your **openspec** skill to:
1) Initialize the change: `openspec init $1`
2) Draft a high-quality `proposal.md` in `openspec/changes/$1/`.
3) Identify initial goals and constraints.
4) Summarize the proposal to the user and suggest next steps (e.g., refining design or `/tk-bootstrap`).

STOP here. Wait for user to review and approve the proposal before proceeding.
