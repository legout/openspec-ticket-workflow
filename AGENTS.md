# Agent Workflow: OpenSpec + Ticket (tk)

This repo uses:
- OpenSpec for spec-driven changes (proposal → setup → archive)
- ticket (tk) for task execution tracking (dependencies, ready/blocked)

## Core rules (must follow)

1) Specs before code
- If there is no active OpenSpec change for the request, create one (proposal) before implementing.
- Use:
  - `openspec list`
  - `openspec show <change>`
  - `openspec validate <change>` before coding when feasible.

2) No "blind" implementation
- Do NOT use commands like `/openspec-apply` or equivalent "auto-implement" tools.
- All implementation must be driven by `tk` tickets.

3) One OpenSpec change = one ticket epic
- Create a tk epic with `--external-ref "openspec:<change-id>"`.

4) Use 3–8 chunky tickets per change (default)
- Create 3–8 task tickets under the epic (deliverables like DB/API/UI/tests/docs).
- Propose these tickets based on the OpenSpec `tasks.md` and `proposal.md`.

5) Drive work via tk queues
- Always pick the next task using `tk ready`.
- Mark progress with `tk start <id>`, notes with `tk add-note <id>`, and completion with `tk close <id>`.

6) Keep OpenSpec tasks in sync
- When a tk task is completed, check off the corresponding items in `openspec/changes/<change>/tasks.md`.
- When all tickets under the epic are complete, archive the change:
  - `openspec archive <change> --yes`

7) Dependencies
- Encode real blockers using `tk dep <id> <dep-id>`.
- Use `tk blocked` when nothing is ready.

8) Git hygiene
- Include the ticket ID in commits when relevant (e.g., "ab-1234: implement API endpoint").

## Working loop (summary)

Identify/create OpenSpec proposal → review/validate → bootstrap tk epic + 3–8 task tickets → loop: `tk ready` → `tk start` → implement → `tk close` → update OpenSpec tasks → all tickets done? → `openspec archive --yes`.
